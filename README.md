# Beck's Simple Factory Game

WIP. Currently in a non-functional state.

A simple voxel engine with the goal of being completely modable and hot-reloadable.


## Building

Pre-requisites:
+ make
+ gcc

After those are installed, simply run `make` from a command line navigated to this folder.

Alternatively, run `build.bat`.
